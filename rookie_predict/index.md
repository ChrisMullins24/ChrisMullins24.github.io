title: NBA Rookie Performance Prediction
---

This is my Academic Project from 2022, Prediciting NBA Rookies Statistics based on their Last Year in College. The research I conducted is about predicting NBA rookie’s stats based on their most recent season’s NCAA stats, instead of using per 36 stats because the statistics could be miscrew based on the player good or bad numbers on the little playing; I decided to use Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) to predict error instead because it is important for future use since situation change upon every year. This research can help predict certain rookies' stat lines in order to make better draft decisions. Using analytics to make an NBA team better can go a long way; I am not promoting
the use of analytics alone, but providing an eye test with analytics in order to make a well educated decision on drafting the best player for NBA teams. 

This study used draft class from 2007 to 2018, which was the last year before Coronavirus (COVID-19) struck NCAA basketball as well, the NBA. Consistent with this dataset, these drafted college basketball players range from one-and-done to four-year players.
